##Â Arduino - Modbus
This repo contains some examples to run a regular webserver or a Modbus server or client on an Arduino UNO with an Ethernet module.

# TODO
- Arduino as Modbus client with Modbus server running in Python
- Test connectivity reliability using Modbus CRC 

Note to self: the main culprit with connectivity issues is IP addressing. When connecting the Ethernet switch, I don't use DHCP (maybe I should?) and instead set my IP address manually. I have used 

- 192.168.1.100 
- 192.168.0.100 

successfully, both with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, meaning I can assign the Arduino any IP address in the third octet, e.g. 192.168.1.177 or 192.168.1.100.
